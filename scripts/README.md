# Scripts

Don't place any scripts directly in this folder. Put them in one of the subdirectories instead.

Put commands you wouldn't mind accidentally running on production into the "safe" directory,
and put everything else into "dangerous".

Make sure you do `chmod +x` with your script before committing.
